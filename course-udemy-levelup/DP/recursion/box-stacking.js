    We are given an array of boxes.
    Each boxes is representated using 3 integers
    denoting, height, width, depth of the box.

    the total goal height of the stak.

    You canÂ´t rotate any box, ie integeres in each box
    must represent [width, depth, height] at all times

    A box must have strictely smaller width, depth and 
    height than any other box below it.
