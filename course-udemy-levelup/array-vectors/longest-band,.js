/*
    Given an array containing N integers, find length
    of longest band.

    A band is defined as a subsecuence
    which can be ordered in such a manner all
    elements appear consecutive (ie with absolute difference
        of  1 between neighborhood elements
    )

    A longest band  is the band  (subsequence) which contains
    maximum integers.
